Tired of not being able to Transmog incomplete sets or the many dungeon/leveling sets not found in the default set list?  Better Wardrobe & Transmog was created to solve these issues and to improve the transmog experience without needing a host of additional addons installed.  It adds new features to the Collection Journal, Transmog Vendor, Dressing Room and tooltip pages.

These include dungeon, questing, event sets and many more from the WoWhead transmog set databse. These sets display like the base sets with a listing of set completion for incomplete sets and a different highlight for completed sets. *Note that many of the recolor/lookalike sets appear to be missing pieces or wrong piece types, this is because many of the sets are are actually incomplete on there listing on WoWHead
